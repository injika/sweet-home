                <section class="ideation"><h1>IDEATION</h1>
                <p>For a user research, I conducted a study and created the personas to analyze pain points and determine priorities. Then I generated Sitemap to understand where in the process users were having troubles, created sketches, Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi prototypes.

                  The project timeline is one week. Let’s dive into the process of creating a responsive website.</p>

                <h2>Sitemap 
                </h2>
                <p>In the site map, i’ll make sure to uncover a seamless user experience with a sitemap designed for flow. From new homes to rent and buy proprties, you can easily navigate through our intuitive interface.

                <h2>Mid-Fi Prototype:</h2>
                <p>I fleshed out the UI sketches, created mid-fi wireframes, and got down the clickable prototype for validation testing. I conducted validation testing, and found out a couple of issues need
                   to be adjusted. For example, to make filters more prominent on the landing page so it can give user a clear signal that it is the primary call to action.</p>

                <h2>Hi-Fi Prototype:</h2>
                <p>After validating my Lo-Fi prototype, I made iterations to my design and moved into the Hi-Fi phase. I created a Hi-Fi prototype for the site’s flow, including an animated background, photos of the proprites, detiels, Navigation Bar and easy searching on the sities.

                <h1>Validation
                </h1>
             
                <p>The interactive prototype performed well during user testing, with positive feedback highlighting:

<li>The visually appealing homepage and animated backgrounds.</li>
<li>Clear and accessible navigation, filters, and contact options.</li>
<li>The smooth transition between diffrent pages.</li></p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p>I made a GIF photos to show you the validation of the site. It works fantastic, and I loved the animated background, which gives the site a more attractive look. Also, having easy-to-use navigation is important for any web site, from choosing what you are looking for to the location, makes every step clear and easy to flow.</p>

                <h1 class="con"> Conclusion:
                </h1>
                <p class="end">This project as a UI designer has been an incredibly fulfilling adventure, and I’m filled with pride and gratitude for the vital lessons I’ve learned along the way. Each day in this role has become a stepping stone towards my professional advancement over the last month, as I continue to use and refine the abilities I’ve learned in real-world circumstances. Notably, I took on the challenge of animating the background in this project, bringing a dynamic and visually interesting element into the user experience and a responsive web app. This endeavor culminated in the successful design of a website that not only meets practical needs but also displays a distinct and innovative look.</p>
